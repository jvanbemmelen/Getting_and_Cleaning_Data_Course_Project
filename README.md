# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

How to run this script:
- download run_analysis.R
- start R in the directory where you downloaded run_analysis.R
- run the R script:
  source("run_analysis.R")
- the file will download the source data and perform the steps described in the assignment. Once finished it will print a message telling you that a variable named avgActivitySubject is available in your workspace, and that a file called avgActivitySubject.R is available in the current work directory. This file is also available in the git repo.


The CodeBook describes the variables in the resulting dataset. It also describes the source data and the performed transformations.
